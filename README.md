Welcome to my personal website!  
This is my little corner on the web, where I share a bit about myself and showcase some of my work and interests.

## About This Site

I started this website after finishing high school as a way to learn more about web development and to keep track of my progress. The main site is a portfolio of sorts, but really, it's just a place where I experiment, try out ideas, and share what Iâ€™ve been learning along the way.

## ðŸ§ª Test Pages

Thereâ€™s also a `TestPages` folder here, which I use to try out new things or host pages that arenâ€™t directly related to the main site. Think of it as a sandbox for experiments and learning.

## ðŸš€ My Journey

Building this site has been a great way to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iâ€™m still learning and improving, and this repository is a reflection of that journey. If you find something interesting, or have suggestions, feel free to reach out!
